#### Classification in Lending: Healthy Loans Vs. High Risk Loans  


## Description
In this challenge, I was assigned the task of creating a model that looks at credit risk in lending. It is important for companies to minimize risk in their lending deals, so having a reliable model enables the companies to make data driven financial decisions. I recommend using this model because of its accuracy & precision.  


The logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, demonstrates high performance in predicting both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels. Here's a breakdown:  

- For label ‘0’ (healthy loan):
Precision, Recall, and F1-score are all very high, indicating that the model accurately predicts healthy loans. The precision is 1.00, meaning that all predicted healthy loans are indeed healthy, and the recall is 1.00, meaning that the model captures almost all actual healthy loans.  

- For label ‘1’ (high-risk loan):
Precision is 0.85, indicating that the model correctly identifies 85% of the predicted high-risk loans. Recall is 0.99, suggesting that the model effectively captures almost all actual high-risk loans. The F1-score is 0.92, reflecting a good balance between precision and recall for high-risk loans.  


Overall, the model achieves a high level of accuracy and balanced performance for both classes after oversampling the data. The improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score for high-risk loans demonstrate the effectiveness of the oversampling technique in addressing the imbalanced nature of the dataset.
To accomplish this analysis, I utilized my Mac OS, Google Colab, and GitHub.
